# SX126x
Arduino library for LoRa Communication using SX126x.
Tested with LoRa module DRF1268T (http://www.dorji.com), as well usable for DRF1262T.

FSK Mode is currently not supported.

#Installing
Download this repo as zip. Then in the Arduino IDE go to Sketch->Add library->add .zip library.
Or please refer to the offical Arduino howto.

#First Steps
The first place to start may be the examples folder. There is a simple rx tx example
which sends data (TX) and echos them back (rx). 

#Hardware
The examle works with the attached schematic. It is designed to enhance my bunch of homeautomation devices (https://github.com/tinytronix/homeautomation).
