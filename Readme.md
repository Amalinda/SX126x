# SX126x
Arduino library for LoRa Communication using SX126x.
Tested with LoRa module DRF1268T (http://www.dorji.com).

For installing the library into your Arduino IDE please refer to the offical Arduino howto.
The first place to start may be the examples folder. There is a simple rx tx example
which sends and receives numbers.

The examle works with the attached schematic. It is designed to enhance my bunch of homeautomation devices (https://github.com/tinytronix/homeautomation).
It will bridge I2C commands from inside the house to some modules installed outside for controlling
the plant watering in the garden. There is also the plan to build several little modules which can be 
placed behind wall power outlets or wall switches.
